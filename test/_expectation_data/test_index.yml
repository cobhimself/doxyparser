# This is the name of the nodes this test data is associated with.
compound:
  # The keys at this level are "node getters". They are appended to `get_` and
  # the combined method is called on the Doxygen class. Example: a key of
  # 'classes' would have a "node getter" value of 'get_classes'.
  classes:
    #Each item in this list represents a single compound node retrieved
    #through the above "node getter". Each item's top-level keys represent
    #"value getters". The keys are appended to `get_` to form the final "value
    #getter" method to be called on the node received from the parent "node
    #getter". The value for the for the keys below can be one of two things:
    #
    #  1. The value to confirm the "value getter" returns.
    #  2. An associative array of specific confirmations to be made.
    #
    # Specific confirmations are specified by a key and the value is what the
    # expectation is. For example, the 'count' key would have a numeric value
    # we expect a count of the items returned by the "value getter" to have.
