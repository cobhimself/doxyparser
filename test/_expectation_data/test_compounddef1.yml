# This is the name of the nodes this test data is associated with.
compounddef:
  # The keys at this level are "node getters". They are appended to `get_` and
  # the combined method is called on the Doxygen class. Example: a key of
  # 'namespace_compounddefs' would have a "node getter" value of
  # 'get_namespace_compounddefs'.
  namespace_compounddefs:
    #Each item in this list represents a single compounddef node retrieved
    #through the above "node getter". Each item's top-level keys represent
    #"value getters". The keys are appended to `get_` to form the final "value
    #getter" method to be called on the node received from the parent "node
    #getter". The value for the below can be one of two things:
    #
    #  1. The value to confirm the "value getter" returns.
    #  2. An associative array of specific confirmations to be made.
    #
    # Specific confirmations are specified by a key and the value is what the
    # expectation is. For example, the 'count' key would have a numeric value
    # we expect a count of the items returned by the "value getter" to have.
    #
    # A 'children' key would specify we want to make additional assertions
    # about the node retrieved through the "node getter". The 'children' key
    # requires a 'getter' with the value to append to `get_` to obtain the
    # child data. The 'expectations' key
